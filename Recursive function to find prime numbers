#The following Python script uses a recursive function to calculate the prime numbers. 
#It incorporates the fact that it is enough to examine the multiples of the prime numbers up to the square root of n:

from math import sqrt
def primes(n):
    if n == 0:
        return []
    elif n == 1:
        return []
    else:
        p = primes(int(sqrt(n)))
        no_p = {j for i in p for j in xrange(i*2, n+1, i)}
        p = {x for x in xrange(2, n + 1) if x not in no_p}
    return p

for i in range(1,50):
    print i, primes(i)
